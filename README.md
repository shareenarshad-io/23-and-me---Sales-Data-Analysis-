23 and Me Data Science Project 

Please answer the questions below based on the data provided:

Plot daily sales for all 50 weeks.
It looks like there has been a sudden change in daily sales. What date did it occur?
Is the change in daily sales at the date you selected statistically significant? If so, what is the p-value?
Does the data suggest that the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers? Please use plots to support your answer (a rigorous statistical analysis is not necessary).
Assume a given day is divided into four dayparts: night (12:00AM - 6:00AM), morning (6:00AM - 12:00PM), afternoon (12:00PM - 6:00PM) and evening (6:00PM - 12:00AM). What is the percentage of sales in each daypart over all 50 weeks?

This project aims to answer the above questions.
